#Summary:
Understanding social media usage patterns is essential for optimizing content strategies, improving audience engagement, and making data-driven decisions. In this project, I explored the analysis of social media data using Python to uncover trends across various content categories and time periods.

#Solution:
My analysis revealed that external factors like content category and posting date significantly influenced engagement (measured through likes). We observed that posts under the Sports category tended to receive higher engagement compared to others.

To solve this, I implemented a pipeline in Python that:

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset,

Visualized engagement trends over time,

Provided actionable insights for better content planning.

By using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, I was able to extract valuable patterns in social media usage. These insights could be used to optimize posting strategies, tailor content for target audiences, and improve engagement.

#Approach:
I began by performing exploratory data analysis using the pandas library. Steps included:

Data Cleaning: Removed null values, duplicates, and ensured consistent data types.

Feature Analysis: Explored key features such as likes, category, and date.

Visualization: Used box plots and line graphs to analyze engagement trends by category and date.

Insights Generation: Identified categories with higher engagement and examined temporal trends.

This project simulated real-world scenarios involving messy data and required analytical thinking to transform raw data into actionable insights.
